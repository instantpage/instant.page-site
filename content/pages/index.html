<p>instant.page uses <b><em>just-in-time preloading</em></b>; it preloads a page right before a user clicks on it.</p>

<p><b>Before a user clicks on a link, they hover their mouse</b> over that link. When a user has hovered for 65&nbsp;ms there is one chance out of two that they will click on that link, so instant.page starts preloading at this moment, leaving on average over 300&nbsp;ms for the page to preload.</p>

<p><b>On mobile, a user starts touching their display before releasing it</b>, leaving on average 90&nbsp;ms for the page to preload.</p>

<p><button class="js-click-test-button button">Test your clicking speed</button> <span class="js-click-test-results click-test-results"></span></p>

<p>You can also click the menu <span class="cta-menu--narrow">at the bottom</span> <span class="cta-menu--large">on the right</span> to experience it.</p>

<h2 id="cheating-the-brain">Cheating the brain</h2>

<p>The humain brain perceives actions taking less than 100&nbsp;ms as instant. <span class="footnote-button"></span> As a result, instant.page <b>makes your site feel instant even on 3G</b> (assuming your pages are fast to render).</p>

  <blockquote class="nielsen-quote">
      <strong>0.1 second</strong> is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is <strong>reacting instantaneously</strong>, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.

<h2 id="easy-on-your-server">Easy on your server and your user’s data plan</h2>

<p><b>Pages are preloaded only when there’s a good chance that a user will visit them, and only the HTML is preloaded</b>, being respectful of your users’ and servers’ bandwidth and CPU.</p>

<p>It uses passive event listeners so that <b>your pages stay smooth</b>. It doesn’t preload when the user has data saver enabled. <b>It’s 1&nbsp;kB</b> and loads after everything else. And <b>it’s free</b> and open source (MIT license).</p>
