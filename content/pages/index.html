<p>Amazon and others found that <b>removing 100 milliseconds of latency improves sales by 1%</b>. <span class="footnote-button"></span> But latency on the web is hard to overcome.</p>

<p>instant.page uses <b><em>just-in-time preloading</em></b> — it preloads a page right before a user clicks on it.</p>

<h3 id="on-desktop">On desktop</h3>

<p><b>Before a user clicks on a link, they hover their mouse</b> over that link. When a user has hovered for 65&nbsp;ms there is one chance out of two that they will click on that link, so instant.page starts preloading at this moment, leaving on average <b>over 300&nbsp;ms for the page to preload</b>.</p>

<p>Another option is to load the pages <b>when the user starts pressing their mouse</b> without preloading. This makes for <b>zero unused requests</b> while still <b>improving page loads by 80&nbsp;ms</b> on average.</p>

<p>You can also preload on hover or as soon as a link is visible and trigger the click when the user starts pressing their mouse, making your pages the fastest in the world.</p>

<h3 id="on-mobile">On mobile</h3>

<p>A user <b>starts touching their display before releasing it</b>, leaving on average <b>90&nbsp;ms for the page to preload</b>.</p>

<p>Another option is to preload links as soon as they’re visible.</p>

<h3 id="try">Try it out</h3>

<p>You can also click the menu <span class="cta-menu--narrow">at the bottom</span> <span class="cta-menu--large">on the right</span> to experience it.</p>

<h2 id="cheating-the-brain">Cheating the brain</h2>

<p>The human brain perceives actions taking less than 100&nbsp;ms as instant. <span class="footnote-button"></span> As a result, instant.page makes <b>your pages feel instant even on 3G</b> (assuming your pages are fast to render).</p>

  <blockquote class="nielsen-quote">
      <strong>0.1 second</strong> is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is <strong>reacting instantaneously</strong>, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.

<h2 id="easy-on-your-server">Easy on your server and your user’s data plan</h2>

<p>Pages are <b>preloaded only when there’s a good chance that a user will visit them, and only the HTML is preloaded</b>, being respectful of your users’ and servers’ bandwidth and CPU.</p>

<p>It uses passive event listeners and requestIdleCallback so that your pages stay smooth. It respects data saver mode. <b>It’s 1&nbsp;kB</b> and loads after everything else. And <b>it’s free</b> and open source (MIT license).</p>
