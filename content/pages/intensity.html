<h1>Intensity</h1>

<p>By default, instant.page preloads 65&nbsp;ms after hovering a link and when a mobile user starts touching their display. There are other options.</p>

<h2 id="mousedown">Preloading when the mouse is pressed</h2>

<p>To load the page when the user starts pressing their mouse button, right before releasing it, add <code class="code">data-instant-intensity="mousedown"</code> as an attribute to the &lt;body&gt;.</p>

<p>This leaves on average 80&nbsp;ms for the page to preload.</p>

<p>To have it this way just on desktop and not preload on mobile, use <code class="code">data-instant-intensity="mousedown-only"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="custom-delay">Adjusting the delay on hover</h2>

<p>For some sites with a lot of huge click targets, such as some e-commerce sites, the 65&nbsp;ms rule doesn’t apply: it will preload more than two times for each page visited.</p>

<p>To increase the delay on hover, pass the number of milliseconds in the attribute, like so for 150&nbsp;ms: <code class="code">data-instant-intensity="150"</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you don’t care about making a lot of requests, you can decrease it.</p>

<h2 id="viewport">Preloading links as soon as they’re visible</h2>

<p>On small mobile devices (such as smartphones) if you want your pages to be instant in more situations you can preload links as soon as they’re visible.</p>

<p>To do so, add <code class="code">data-instant-intensity="viewport"</code> as an attribute to the &lt;body&gt;.</p>

<p>You can also do so on other form factors by using <code class="code">"viewport-all"</code>, if you’re not worried about making <em>a lot</em> of requests.</p>

<p>Note that if the user is on 2G or has data saver enabled it will fall back to using the default options.</p>

<h2 id="mousedown-shorcut">Triggering a click when the mouse is pressed</h2>

<p>If you want to trigger a click faster, add <code class="code">data-instant-mousedown-shortcut</code> as an attribute to the &lt;body&gt;. Note though that this can conflict with existing scripts.</p>

<p>(This feature is opt-in since v5.1, in 5.0 it was enabled by default and you needed to use <code class="code">data-instant-no-mousedown-shortcut</code> to disable it.)</p>
