<h1 class="title">instant.page 5.0 — Make your site’s pages faster than any other site on the planet, faster than instant, in 1 minute.</h1>

<p><a href="/">instant.page</a> uses just-in-time preloading to make your site’s pages instant, by preloading shortly after the user hovers their mouse over a link on desktop, or starts touching their display on mobile.</p>

<p>instant.page 5.0 now makes your site’s pages <em>faster than instant</em> on desktop.</p>

<p>instant.page doesn’t wait for the user to click anymore, <strong>it triggers the page load when the user starts pressing their mouse</strong>.</p>

<p>This makes your site’s pages the fastest in the world, faster than anything else you’ve ever seen. And it improves your conversion rate nicely.</p>

<p>To make your site’s pages the fastest in the world, it just takes one minute:</p>

<include>cta-widget</include>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since 5.1 you need to also add <code class="code">data-instant-mousedown-shortcut</code> as an attribute to the &lt;body&gt; to enable it, as it’s been known to conflict with some existing scripts.</p>

<p>Because this cuts into the time instant.page gets to preload on hover, if your pages take more than 100&nbsp;ms to be delivered, you might not see a speed boost. In that case consider preloading as soon as the links are visible, with a <code class="code">data-instant-intensity="viewport-all"</code> attribute that you add to the &lt;body&gt;.</p>

<p>This is then similar to quicklink, with the added benefit that page loads display on average 80&nbsp;ms faster. instant.page also has the advantage to fallback to preloading on touch start if the user has data saver enabled or is on 2G, which is important if you care about emerging markets.</p>
